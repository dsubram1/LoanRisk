Introduction 

This project deals with a classification problem, where our goal is to predict bad loans from given set of attributes and thus helping Lending Club to reduce the default risk for loans.


What is Lending Club?

●	Lending Club is a California based peer-to-peer lending company, one of the largest in United States. 

●	Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request.

●	It allows borrowers to request for unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000 and the standard loan period is three years.

●	Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. 

●	The people who want to invest some money (Investors) in the loans, can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on various information provided in the website.

●	 The investors make money from the interest that the borrowers pay. Also, a small amount is charged by the Lending club from both investors as well as borrowers in the form of fees.


Problem we are trying to solve

●	The default rate for lending club was about 5% for 2016.

●	For regular banks this default rate will not be an issue as they have other means to make up for the loss. 

●	But for lending club, this is a really concerning issue because the investor must take the full brunt of the loss when a borrower default.

●	And its most likely that he would never again invest in lending club and would also advice people he/she knows to not invest which in turn would affect lending club’s growth and profit. 

●	Predicting whether the borrowers will be able to pay back their loan amount in time and only then approving their loan request.

●	This would greatly help the organization to reduce the default risk for loans. Also, this would improve the company’s profitability and credibility among investors.
